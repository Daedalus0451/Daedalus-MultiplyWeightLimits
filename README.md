# Daedalus-MultiplyWeightLimits
Modifies your PMC's OverweightLimits to a multiplier of your choice set in the config, by default 1.5 (50%). At the default value it substantially increases both the maximum weight your PMC can carry, and the thresholds where they will start being encumbered, slowed down and suffer stamina penalties.

Multiplies the following globals:

Globals.Configuration.Stamina.BaseOverweightLimits
Globals.Configuration.Stamina.SprintOverweightLimits
Globals.Configuration.Stamina.WalkOverweightLimits
Globals.Configuration.Stamina.WalkSpeedOverweightLimits
